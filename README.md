In today’s data-driven world, integrating external data sources and visualizing them meaningfully is essential for building smart applications and making informed decisions. This project demonstrates how to perform API integration in Python and create a visual dashboard using public weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It also highlights how such data can be transformed, cleaned, and visualized using Python’s powerful data libraries.OpenWeatherMap, also known as OpenWeather, is a widely used online service that provides weather data via an Application Programming Interface (API). It offers current weather, forecasts, historical weather, and even environmental data such as air pollution. OpenWeather is one of the most popular weather data providers for developers and organizations building weather-based applications, dashboards, or IoT systems.
